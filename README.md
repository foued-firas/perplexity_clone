Building a Perplexity Clone: AI-Powered Search with Flutter, FastAPI & Gemini AI! 🤖✨
I'm thrilled to share my latest project—a Perplexity AI Clone that combines AI-powered search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Flutter, FastAPI (Python), and Google Gemini AI!
🔍 How It Works:
1️⃣ Web Search with Tavily API → Finds relevant sources from the web.
2️⃣ Content Extraction with Trafilatura → Cleans and extracts text from web pages.
3️⃣ Semantic Ranking with Sentence Transformers → Sorts results based on similarity to the user query.
4️⃣ AI-Powered Answer Generation with Google Gemini → Generates detailed responses using the best-ranked sources.
5️⃣ Flutter Frontend for a Seamless UI → Provides a user-friendly experience across mobile & web.
⚙️ Tech Stack Used:
🔹 Frontend: Flutter (Dart) – Cross-platform (Mobile & Web)
🔹 Backend: FastAPI (Python)
🔹 AI Model: Google Gemini AI
🔹 Search API: Tavily
🔹 Text Processing: Trafilatura
🔹 Embedding Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (Sentence Transformers)
